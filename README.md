Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

# EasyBooking Backend
EasyBooking backend project.

# Getting Started

## Install Dependencies
Install Node modules by the following command.
```sh
npm i
```

## Running a MongoDB Instance
Run a MongoDB instance and put the connection string into _imports_ part of _src/app.module.ts_. For example, there is a MongoDB instance running at _locahost:27017_ without password, then you should config it like this.
```ts
@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost:27017'),
  ],
  // something else
})
export class AppModule {}
```
You do not need to do anything else with the DB, the backend app would initialize it automatically.

### Starting MongoDB Instance Using Docker
To make it simple, you can start a MongoDB instance using Docker by the command below. It gives you a empty MongoDB instance called _mongo_ with no password and a random port opened.
```sh
docker run --name mongo -P -d mongo
```
You can check the randomly opened port number by running below command after starting the container.
```sh
docker ps
```
Note that this would create a MongoDB container without data persistence. If you want to persist the data, considering using ```-v``` flag for ```docker run```. 

### Running the Backend App
To Run the app, use the following command, which the app would start and listen to port _3000_ on _localhost_.
```sh
npm run start
```
# Project Structure
Except the _app module_, there are three main modules.
## Controller
This module would hold all the API endpoint handlers, which basically contains _controllers_ in NestJS concept. Any _controller_ here should only handle the API requests and should not contain bussiness logic. They can use services from Service and Repository modules.
## Service
This module would hold all the general services, such as business logic, which basically contains _services_ in NestJS concept. Any _service_ here should not contain API processing logic. They can use services from Repository module.
## Repository
This module would hold all the services about accessing database, which basically contains _services_ in NestJS concept. Any _service_ here should only provide database access and should not contain bussiness logic.

# Function Explain

## Login

run `curl -X POST -H Content-type:application/json -d '{ "username": "will", "authenticationHash" : "authHash" }' 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/sign-in'` inside bash,
or use any application you like to make request.
I suggest using Postman.

the return format should be:

```
{"access_token": ..., "refresh_token": ...}
```

## Refresh

run `curl -X POST -H Content-type:application/json -H "Authorization: Bearer [refresh_token] " 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/refresh-access-token'`

the return format should be:

```
{
    "refresh_refresh": true if refresh token is refreshed otherwise false,
    "access_token": ...,
    "refresh_token": ... if refresh token is refreshed otherwise null
}
```

## Logout

run `curl -X POST -H Content-type:application/json -H "Authorization: Bearer [access_token] " 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/sign-out'`

the return format should be: status 200. And if you take a look at database, token is null. 

Notice: if you run ```Refresh``` after ```Logout``` it will return ```INSUFFICIENT PRIVILEGES```
